Description: RuleDispatch
        ============
        
        RuleDispatch is a prototype implementation of the Chambers and Chen
        "efficient multiple and predicate dispatch" algorithm for Python.  It lets you
        specify a function in terms of a collection of arbitrary rules, including
        Lisp-style "before/after/around" methods.
        
        Although it is used by various projects, including ``peak.security.rules`` and
        TurboGears, it is no longer being actively developed.  It is expected to be
        replaced by the more extensible PEAK-Rules package, which is currently in
        development (with snapshot and SVN releases available in PyPI).
        
        Please note that if you are starting new development, you are almost certainly
        better off using PEAK-Rules instead.  It is smaller, has a simpler API, and for
        certain use cases can be significantly faster than RuleDispatch.  It was also
        developed from the ground up using TDD, which means that every single line of
        its code is tested.  In contrast, the central core of RuleDispatch was
        developed many years ago using a hack, slash, and burn methodology, with only
        some functional tests and very few unit tests.  The consequences of this can be
        seen in the number of RuleDispatch bugs that have occurred over the last few
        years that involve the core engine in some way.
        
        So, although I will continue to accept bug reports and apply fixes to
        RuleDispatch, it is absolutely a dead parrot, and there are no plans to update
        its documentation, tests, or anything else.  Use it at your own risk.
        
        
        Python 2.5 Issues
        -----------------
        RuleDispatch has not been updated for certain additions to the Python 2.5
        grammar.  It does not support any kind of loops, generator expressions or
        "y if x else z" conditional expressions in rules, and its behavior if you use
        them is undefined.
